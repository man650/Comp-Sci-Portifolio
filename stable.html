    <h3> What is Vindinium?</h3>
    <p>This is an Ai challenge and each person in 
        our class made their bots different like attack other 
        bots when they are close, attack the bot with the 
        most gold mines and they go in the arena and they 
        attack or get gold mines and they start to get gold
        depends on how much gold mines they have. In order to win you need to have a lot of gold and 
        to get gold you need to attack a goblin guarding a gold mine and when you get control over it, you lose health and the color of that 
        gold mine is yours and if the color is red and that gold mine will belong to the bot that is red. If a bot attacks another bot 
        the bot that attacked him will get all the gold mines that bot had. The bot who has the most gold has a 
        crown top of his head and if another bot has more gold than the bot who had the 
        crown, he will lose the crown and the one with the most gold will have a crown on his head.</p>
    
    <h3> How does my Bot work?</h3>
    <p>My bot works in javascript. Javascript makes effects in the websites. I made my bot attack the bot with the most gold mines and the code that I put
    him to attack the bot with the most gold mines, he will find the bot with the most 
        gold mines by looking at their index, index is the number and the bot's index start from 0-2 and if number one 
        has the most gold mines, my bot will attack him when he is close. I also made my bot steal gold mines, he will steal the closest gold mines and 
        he will steal other people's gold mines that are the closest to himl. When my bot's health is lower than 40, he will go for a tavern and he will get his 
        health up when he goes there and tavern looks like a glass root beer mug. And sometimes he will go randome when he can't reach a place. My bot will attack 
        bots that are close to him and have low health and if the closest bot has more health than my bot than he will go for a gold mine. </p>
