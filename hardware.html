<p>This is the brain of the computer and you put every cable in this motherboard.
<ul>
  <li>The motherboard serves to connect all of the parts of a computer together. The CPU, memory, hard drives, optical drives, video card, sound card and other ports and expansion cards all connect to the motherboard directly or via cables.</li>
  <li>The front of the motherboard contains ports that all of the internal components connect to. A single socket/slot houses the CPU. Multiple slots allow for one or more memory modules to be attached. Other ports reside on the motherboard which allow the hard drive and optical drive (and floppy drive if present) to connect via data cables.</li>
  <li>Motherboards vary greatly in respect to the types of components they support. For example, each motherboard supports a single type of CPU and a short list of memory types. Additionally, some video cards, hard drives and other peripherals may not be compatible. The motherboard manufacturer should provide clear guidance on component compatibilities.</li>

  <li>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the computer's hardware and software.</li>
  <li>Not all central processing units have pins on their bottom sides, but in the ones that do, the pins are easily bent. Take great care when handling, especially when installing onto the motherboard.</li>
  <li>Each motherboard supports only a certain range of CPU types so always check with your motherboard manufacturer before making a purchase</li>
  <li>A modern CPU is usually small and square with many short, rounded, metallic connectors on its underside. Some older CPUs have pins instead metallic connectors.</li>
<li>After running even a short while, modern CPUs can get very hot. To help dissipate this heat, it is necessary to attach a heat sink and a fan directly on top of the CPU. Typically, these come bundled with a CPU purchase</li>

  <li>Random Access Memory (RAM) is the "working memory" in a computer.</li>
<li>Additional RAM allows a computer to work with more information at the same time which can have a dramatic effect on total system performance.</li>  
<li>RAM is typically referred to simply as "memory" even though other types of memory may exist inside a computer.</li>
<li>A standard "module" or "stick" of desktop memory is a long, thin piece of hardware and resembles a short ruler. The bottom of the memory module has one or more notches to guide for proper installation and is lined with numerous, usually gold-plated connectors.</li>
<li>Memory is installed in memory module slots located on the motherboard. These slots are easily locatable by looking for the small hinges on either side that lock the memory in place. Certain sizes of modules may need to be installed in certain slots so always check with your motherboard manufacturer before purchase or installation.</li>
<li>Memory modules come with various storage capabilities. Modern memory modules can be purchased in 256MB, 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB sizes.</li>

    <ul>    
     <li>The video card is an expansion card that allows the computer to send graphical information to a video display device such as a monitor, TV, or projector.</li>
  <li>Each motherboard only has a limited range of video cards</li>
</ul>

     <li>The power supply unit is the piece of hardware that's used to convert the power provided from the outlet into usable power for the many parts inside the computer case." </li>
